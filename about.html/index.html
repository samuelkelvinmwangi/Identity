                        We all have a certain image of ourselves - beliefs about the kind of person we are. Having a strong sense of identity seems to be desirable, something that brings comfort and security . Many people seem to spend a lot of time trying to figure out who they are, what they want, and what they believe. It brings to us a sence of belonging.

                        Here at identity we enable you to find the Akan name according to the culture of the country here in Ghana. This is done by discovering the day of the week in which you were born by using the birth date. The results are then used to determine the name that should be given to you as an individual. This is done by using a simple algorithm.
